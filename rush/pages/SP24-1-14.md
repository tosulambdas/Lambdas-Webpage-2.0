The Associate Chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon International Fraternity Inc. at The Ohio State University would like to invite you to our Spring 2024 Rush: Quest for Brotherhood - First Edition. Heroes will rise, Villains will fall and a new chapter of excitement is about to begin. We look forward to seeing you there!

# 𝐖𝐇𝐎 𝐀𝐑𝐄 𝐖𝐄?

Established on February 25, 1981, Lambda Phi Epsilon is the largest and only international Asian-interest, but not Asian exclusive, Fraternity in the United States. We currently have over 60 chapters and a network of thousands of brothers in every field. Our continuous goal is to develop every single member to be the best they can be and to become leaders among men.
# 𝐖𝐇𝐀𝐓 𝐈𝐒 𝐑𝐔𝐒𝐇?

Rush is a two week period where rushees can attend events to have a chance to learn about our fraternity and get to know the brothers. All of the events are free and non-obligatory. So come out, have some fun, and see if this brotherhood is fit for you!
