                            <p>Rush, also known as recruitment, is a structured two-week
                                period at the beginning of fall and winter quarter when
                                anyone interested in Lambda Phi Epsilon or Greek life in
                                general can come to our events to meet brothers and learn
                                more about the fraternity. Contrary to popular belief,
                                coming out to rush does not commit you to anything at all.
                                You do not have to attend all events to be able to join the
                                fraternity. The only thing we expect from our rushees
                                (prospective members) is that they have a good time at our
                                events. Along the way, we hope that rushees will also meet
                                the brothers and learn more about the values of the
                                fraternity.</p>

                            <p>A bid is an invitation to enter the new member education

                                are given at the end of rush to rushees who the brothers
                                feel would be a good fit to our fraternity. You are not
                                obligated to accept a bid if given one; rush is completely
                                non-committal.</p>

                                with whom you have an instant bond because of the ideals and

                            <p>Why Lambdas? Lambda Phi Epsilon is an organization that will
                                challenge every aspect of your college life—and for the
                                better. You will learn how to become a leader in your
                                school, in your community, and in the world you enter after
                                college. Lambda life extends far beyond the reach of your
                                school. Today, with thousands of brothers from coast to
                                coast and throughout the world, Lambda Phi Epsilon has
                                become a major institution and a powerful force in the
                                Asian-American scene in the United States. Moreover, your
                                social network on will also expand exponentially as you get
                                to interact with countless men and women affiliated with
                                other Greek organizations, and Lambda alumni who have become
                                very distinguished in their industry. Being a Lambda also
                                carries with it a strong sense of pride and a reputation of
                                being a well-rounded individual. The road to becoming a
                                Lambda is not easy, but the rewards (personal growth,
                                leadership development, etc.) are well worth it. It takes a
                                certain type of man to become a Lambda, someone who wants to
                                become a leader among men.</p>
