    <div class="accordion-container" style="padding-top: 5%;">
        <div class="accordion-group">
            <button class="accordion">What is rush?<i
                    class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Rush, also known as recruitment, is a structured two-week
                    period at the beginning of fall and winter quarter when
                    anyone interested in Lambda Phi Epsilon or Greek life in
                    general can come to our events to meet brothers and learn
                    more about the fraternity. Contrary to popular belief,
                    coming out to rush does not commit you to anything at all.
                    You do not have to attend all events to be able to join the
                    fraternity. The only thing we expect from our rushees
                    (prospective members) is that they have a good time at our
                    events. Along the way, we hope that rushees will also meet
                    the brothers and learn more about the values of the
                    fraternity.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">What is a bid?<i
                    class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>A bid is an invitation to enter the new member education
                    process and continue on the path of becoming a brother. Bids
                    are given at the end of rush to rushees who the brothers
                    feel would be a good fit to our fraternity. You are not
                    obligated to accept a bid if given one; rush is completely
                    non-committal.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Am I required to join if I attend rush
                events?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>No. Rush is simply an opportunity for you to introduce
                    yourself and meet the brothers. So have fun, enjoy yourself,
                    and allow us to show you what our brotherhood can offer you.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion">Do I have to pay to check out rush events?<i
                    class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>No, all rush events are free. All costs are funded by Lambda
                    Phi Epsilon. Rides to all events will be provided as well,
                    if the need arises.</p>

            <button class="accordion">What type of person are you looking for?<i
                    class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>The diversity of our fraternity is due to the individual
                    personalities that make up the house. However, our motto,
                    ‚ÄúLeaders Among Men,‚Äù applies to each and every brother. We
                    are looking for the leaders among the crowd, who will
                    ultimately become the faces of our fraternity.</p>

            <button class="accordion">What is the New Member Education Process?<i
                    class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>If, at the end of rush, you accept the opportunity to
                    complete the New Member Education Process of Lambda Phi
                    Epsilon, the possibilities are endless. Stressing skills
                    such as leadership, communication, organization, and
                    punctuality, the fraternity's education process will help
                    you develop close bonds of brotherhood with men from all
                    walks of life. These abilities have proven highly useful to
                    brothers well outside the bounds of the fraternity. With an
                    alumni network stretching from Tokyo to London, and with
                    chapters at over 70 universities, you will meet brothers
                    with whom you have an instant bond because of the ideals and
                    experiences instilled during pledging. Simply put, Lambdas
                    is an experience that can greatly enrich your time at THE
                    Ohio State University. Don't be fooled by the stereotypes.</p>

            <button class="accordion">Why LPhiE?<i
                    class="fas fa-chevron-down arrow"></i></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Why Lambdas? Lambda Phi Epsilon is an organization that will
                    challenge every aspect of your college life‚Äîand for the
                    better. You will learn how to become a leader in your
                    school, in your community, and in the world you enter after
                    college. Lambda life extends far beyond the reach of your
                    school. Today, with thousands of brothers from coast to
                    coast and throughout the world, Lambda Phi Epsilon has
                    become a major institution and a powerful force in the
                    Asian-American scene in the United States. Moreover, your
                    social network on will also expand exponentially as you get
                    to interact with countless men and women affiliated with
                    other Greek organizations, and Lambda alumni who have become
                    very distinguished in their industry. Being a Lambda also
                    carries with it a strong sense of pride and a reputation of
                    being a well-rounded individual. The road to becoming a
                    Lambda is not easy, but the rewards (personal growth,
                    leadership development, etc.) are well worth it. It takes a
                    certain type of man to become a Lambda, someone who wants to
                    become a leader among men.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>While we are an Asian American interest fraternity, there are
                    brothers all over the country with ethnicities other than
                    Asian. You do not have to be Asian to come to rush events
